                  Let's take a moment to talk about recruiting, because it
                  matters deeply to the long-term strength of Mōchirīī. This is
                  for everyone who cares about the guild's future, whether you
                  arrived recently or have been here long enough to feel at
                  home. Recruiting is a skill that grows through practice,
                  observation, and intention. Every conversation teaches you
                  something. Every interaction sharpens your sense of what
                  brings people in and what helps them stay.
                </p>

                <p>
                  As you listen, take what resonates and try it in your own way.
                  The most important part is participation. Even one new member
                  matters. If each of us brought in a single person, the guild
                  would grow faster than we expect. That one person might become
                  a long-term veteran, a future leader, or someone who quietly
                  supports others and keeps the guild steady during slower
                  seasons.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Growth and quality rise together. Numbers give a guild energy.
                  Energy creates presence. Presence builds confidence. A living
                  guild draws people in because it feels active and welcoming.
                  Some members stay casually, some grow into core contributors,
                  and some step forward as leaders over time. Patterns emerge
                  only through motion. Momentum gives us that motion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A healthy guild thrives around a strong, steady population.
                  That gives room for events, mentorship, leadership
                  development, and different playstyles to coexist naturally.
                  When people log in and see life around them, they feel
                  connected. That sense of connection keeps communities strong.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Recruiting happens in many ways. Forum posts still matter,
                  especially when they stay current and reflect real activity.
                  Playing together matters even more. Shared experiences create
                  trust. When runs feel smooth and friendly, people remember
                  that. Conversations begin naturally. Community grows from
                  there. Sometimes recruiting is as simple as paying attention.
                  When someone mentions looking for a guild, reaching out with
                  curiosity and care opens the door. Announcements also have
                  their place during quieter periods. Clear, respectful messages
                  create opportunities for conversation and connection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  When recruiting feels slow, the answer usually lies in
                  retention. People stay when they feel seen, guided, and
                  included. Structure supports that feeling. Organization gives
                  people a place to belong and a path to follow.
                </p>

                <p>
                  To everyone helping with recruitment, your effort matters.
                  Every message, every conversation, every invitation
                  strengthens the guild. To those in leadership, remember that
                  today's dedicated members shape tomorrow's direction. Support
                  them. Help them find their footing. Give them space to grow
                  into themselves.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Mōchirīī is meant to feel warm, alive, and welcoming. We build
                  that together, one person at a time. Let's continue growing
                  something worth staying for.
